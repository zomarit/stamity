 * Aggregate content SHA-256 pins for the bundled first-party packs: one pin

 * sorted `pack.json` integrity map. The curated catalog (./curated.ts) grants
 * its trust tiers against these exact digests — pinned-or-refuse — and the
 * pins-in-sync suite (test/pack/curated.test.ts) fails on any drift between
 * this module, the pack manifests, and the bytes on disk.
